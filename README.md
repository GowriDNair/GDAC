This repository contains the python notebook of my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. Bellabeat, a women's wellness company, sought to release an activity tracker as their latest product, and required data-driven ideas regarding how to design the same. I was presented with multiple datasets comprising of health data collected by fitbits (activity trackers for daily wear). This data was to be aggregated and analyzed to understand how users currently utilize their activity trackers. With this information, I made recommendations for improvements that can be made to current activity tracker designs.
